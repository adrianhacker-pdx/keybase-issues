Document robustness of Keybase timestamps under various threat models #3489

Finding a side by side comparison of timestamping is difficult, however, I found two scholarly articles about Timestamping.  
One of them includes a method of trustless decentralized unalterable timestamping using the Bitcoin blockchain.  Here are
the links to the articles from Google Scholar:

As far as keybase goes, from the research that I did, the disarray of the documentation makes me wonder about the state of
the product.  :-/
